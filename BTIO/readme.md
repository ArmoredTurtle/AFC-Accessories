The BoxTurtle IO (BTIO) module simplifies the integration of your BoxTurtle multi-color system with your 3D printer by serving as a centralized hub for all essential connections. It offers a clean, dependable interface for linking the printer, connecting the toolhead buffer, and supporting daisy-chained configurations for multi-unit expansion. BTIO also enables external power delivery when operating over USB. This modular design supports scalable, intelligent filament handling while keeping wiring complexity to a minimum.
